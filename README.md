# DS_Projects
This repository is a collection of Data Science Projects which I have done in the past and a repository I keep adding to, as I pursue this as a hobby.
Current projects -
1. Loan Prediction - A logistic regression algorithm implementation for predicting customers who can be approved loans - the algorithm generates a 80% accuracy against the test data.
2. Home Credit Default Risk Challenge - A kaggle event whose code can be found here
